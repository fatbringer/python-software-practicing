Here i put codes that i wrote in the past as practice
either for online courses or for platforms like hackerrank or something

Here are some notable learnings


# Reading input from stdin
eg a = int(input()) 
this reads the input and convert into a int. Else it is a string. 

# strings
> 1) string.isalnum() 
> 2) str.isalpha()
3) str.islower()
4) str.isupper()
